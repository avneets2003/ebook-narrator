I am sharing some text copied from a page or several pages of a PDF document with you. I want you to perform the following modifications to this text:

1. Remove unnecessary whitespace characters, including newline characters.
2. A word at the end of a line might be broken into two parts separated by a hyphen. Join the parts if required to create a meaningful word.
3. There might be some text at the beginning and end of a page, like page number or book name. Remove those.
4. Sentences at the beginning and end of a page might be incomplete since it is split into two pages. Do not complete such sentences.
5. Remove any URLs in the text.

Positively do not add any comment or paraphrase the text.

Here's the text:
